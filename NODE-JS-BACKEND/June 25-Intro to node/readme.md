E=execute
p=print
l=loop

#
# one moe global is MODULE 
console.log(module);
# so now we have to understand the what is module 
# so for this we have to understand module pattern of NODEjs

* NODEjs introduce a new pattern of programming for structuring  of your code 

# Module pattern



# Module global is just  a object where export is key and object is a value  you can also update it 
# in the export key you dont want object you can passed just an fucntion 
* in SEarching.js 

 <!-- module.exports={ 
    linear:linearSearch,
    binary:binarySearch
} -->

* module.export=linearSearch

# so we can import by two ways one is by make the  file extension .mjs like home .mjs 
# and in home.mjs we print 
# import Searching from "./Searching.js";
# console.log(Searching);


* package = it is a folder which contains a package.json file 
# json stand for javascript object notation 
#
